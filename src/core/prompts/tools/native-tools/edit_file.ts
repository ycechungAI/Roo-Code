const EDIT_FILE_DESCRIPTION = `Use this tool to replace text in an existing file, or create a new file.

This tool performs literal string replacement with support for multiple occurrences.

USAGE PATTERNS:

1. MODIFY EXISTING FILE (default):
   - Provide file_path, old_string (text to find), and new_string (replacement)
   - By default, expects exactly 1 occurrence of old_string
   - Use expected_replacements to replace multiple occurrences

2. CREATE NEW FILE:
   - Set old_string to empty string ""
   - new_string becomes the entire file content
   - File must not already exist

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:

1. EXACT MATCHING: The old_string must match the file contents EXACTLY, including:
   - All whitespace (spaces, tabs, newlines)
   - All indentation
   - All punctuation and special characters

2. CONTEXT FOR UNIQUENESS: For single replacements (default), include at least 3 lines of context BEFORE and AFTER the target text to ensure uniqueness.

3. MULTIPLE REPLACEMENTS: If you need to replace multiple identical occurrences:
   - Set expected_replacements to the exact count you expect to replace
   - ALL occurrences will be replaced

4. NO ESCAPING: Provide the literal text - do not escape special characters.`
